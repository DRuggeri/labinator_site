Welcome to the doco page for Labinator, a portable experimentation lab for all manner of server-y goodness.
Using the navigation folders to the left, have a look around.
You'll find all sorts of stuff such as [why](about) this thing even exists, [what](bom) it is made of, and how it came together.

The concept of Labinator came into mind during some time off during 2024 Thanksgiving break.
I primarily wanted a cheap way to experiment with server orchestration from virtualization up the stack through to containers.
At that time, the idea of a mobile lab wasn't even on the radar.
But as I experimented with some of the [https://talos.dev](newer technologies) making their presence known on the scene (and even some of the [older ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) used in neat ways), I was inspired to take the lab on the road to *show* people how neat things can get.
