# Labinator

Labinator is the outcome of several weeks of experimentation and playing in my homelab. At the time, my main objective was to experiment with lightweight ways to stand up, run, and operate a Kubernetes cluster. This is awesome both for home use and [dayjob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielruggeri). After all - rapid experimentation allows for quick try/fail/retry cycles until a winning combination is found!
