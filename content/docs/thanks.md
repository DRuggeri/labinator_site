Title: Words of Thanks

A few content creators and "random Internet folks" have taken the time to share their learnings, code, and links on various blogs or sites. Some have been so handy they are worth a shoutout. I started collecting some of these links far too late in the process so only wish I had the foresight to create an index since the get-go!
