Title: Words of Thanks
---

A few content creators and "random Internet folks" have taken the time to share their learnings, code, and links on various blogs or sites. Some have been so handy they are worth a shoutout. I started collecting some of these links far too late in the process so only wish I had the foresight to create an index since the get-go!

#### Blogs
* Thanks to [Werner Rothschopf](https://werner.rothschopf.net/index.htm) for sharing his [analysis of the ESP32 relay board](https://werner.rothschopf.net/microcontroller/202208_esp32_relay_x8_en.htm)
* Thanks to [Dawid Zyla](https://www.dzyla.com/about/about/) for sharing his [quick and easy Hugo shortcode for image galleries](https://www.dzyla.com/blog/post38/)

#### Projects
* [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - a project by [Vjacheslav Trushkin](https://iconify.design/about/) to collect Open Source icons
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - the best static content site generator which has rendered these pages you're viewing
