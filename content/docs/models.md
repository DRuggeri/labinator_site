One of the principles of Labinator is that it had to be portable. While there are a lot of cheap/easy ways to meet this requirement, it certainly doesn't cause any harm to add a little flair or polish to everything. Besides... home labbing is an awesome hobby - so why not incorporate *more hobbies* into the process?

Enter: 3D modelling and 3D printing

During the pandemic I finally broke down and bought a 3D printer. I've always been interested in them and like many others, I had a bit more time on my hands than I knew what to do with! Having experimented with spline-based and polygonal 3D modeling in the past as well as playing around in Sketchup for years for other projects needing a twist of 3D, I dove in.

The below models were designed with the objectives of providing secure mounting for the portable lab, a modest amount of protection for the components while traveling, and the ability to be mounted/unmounted (possibly with some disassembly of Labinator) to replace components.
