ATX Mount:

    Most interestingly about this mount is the fact that it made me realize how out of square my 3D printer is.
    Because of the size of the mount and the need to print it "sideways" to fit the print bed, it was fairly tall coming from the print bed.
    When I started test fitting the power supply into the mount, my usual .3mm of embiggening for the actual device to fit led to WAY too tight of a fit.
    On investigation, this turned out to be because of how skewed the print gets as the Z axis increases.
    Even further, when I test fitted the mount onto the board, it was painfully obvious how out of squre the base was given that the board is nice and squarely cut.
    Not a big deal - PLA can flex a bit before breaking so this one needed some elbow grease to fit optimally.
    Once fit on the board, heating up the bushing to the point that the plastic started to melt allowed the bushing to move a bit to reduce strain.

    The first prototype fit the ATX panel screw holes well given that the [ATX spec defines where they should be](https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/tech-talk/10055).
    However, the power supply in hand turned out to be deeper than standard spec, so it necessitated a second print to fit the PSU and also keep the fan opening clear.

    This was the only print that I decided to do some manual post processing to, primarily because of the nearly day-long print time, after final fitment.
    The power switch toggle and screw holes for the power cable itself slightly protruded into border.
    No matter... that's nothing two minutes with some wood files couldn't fix!

Cable Comb:

    These little guys were kind of fun but also a bit nervewracking.
    For the design, I wanted a cable comb that could hold just the right amount of wires for a single worker node, but also be flexible enough to use for the mess of wires under the worker nodes.
    The end result was simply a cable comb that could comfortably hold two Cat 6 cables and a third opening on the bottom to hold the power button toggle wires.
    Before designing anything, I had to do a bit of thinking for how to mount these combs without the bushing being blocked but also to print in a way that the layer lines wouldn't coincide with the stresses the cable would exert on the openings.
    Since 3D prints are weakest along the layer lines, this meant the "bottom" of the print would be the side of the comb.

    Only two prototypes were needed for this one because I had already designed some parametric cable combs for mounting wires headed to my data rack.
    One clever design facet to point out is that the comb has a small opening at the bottom and a notch at the top to catch a cable securing ziptie or velcro strap.
    I knew this would be important because the bottom wires would require doubling up several runs such that they won't fit "in" the comb.

ESPLCD Button:

    This little guy isn't very special. It's just a button that fits into the hole on the top of the [ESPLCD Screen](../esplcd-screen) model.
    It didn't take many prototypes to get right because it is so simple.

    The first prototype didn't work out very well because of the limited amount of space between the inside of the [ESPLCD Screen](../esplcd-screen) and the actual button on the board.
    This necessitated creating a small "divot" on the inside bottom of the button as an offset.
    At the very small scale of the layer height (only .2mm) for these prints, I don't know if that little divot even did much!

    Thankfully this one was not terrible to create because I had already made and tested the [LCD - HDMI Screen](../lcd-hdmi-screen).
    For all intents and purposes, this is the same model.

    To get it to fit the slightly different dimensions of the screen, the only things that had to be adjusted were the screw hole mounting offsets, screen offsets, and side openings.
    The side openings were a bit tricky which led to creating three different prototypes.
    The first prototype, I guess due to some measuring error, had the button hole several mm away from where it needed to be.
    That wasn't a big deal because the side holes for the power/HDMI in were also a bit off (I guess it's impossible for me to hit everything right on the money on the first try).
    As is typical, the second prototype brought everything much closer to where it needed to be while the third was the final dial-in prototype.

Holster with Screen:

  prototypes: 6
  content: |-
    These were the (least) fun ones! It required quite a bit of noodling on how to set device up so the ports were accessible and the device could be removed from the holster for maintenance.
    I decided I wanted an open-side design fairly early to keep accessing the ports simple, reduce the amount of waste filament, and strike that nice visual appeal.
    Because the [LCD - HDMI Screen](../lcd-hdmi-screen) needed to be mounted on top of this, I had to finish that model's prototypes and production print first to determine the exact dimensions of the "stilts" that reach up to hold the screen.
    With the [LCD - HDMI Screen](../lcd-hdmi-screen) being secured by screws, it also required me to ensure accurate depth (and access!) to the fastening points from under neath which led to an "open" bottom.
    I'm glad I realized that because there would've been no way to screw the screen on!
    Similarly, to secure the model to the board, I placed 4mm holes.
    These holes needed to be strategically placed so they did not sit in the way of the "feet" on the bottom of the computer as it slid in or out of the holster.
    After having decided that I wanted the machines to slide into the holster, I needed to figure out how to secure them in place.
    The end solution was to capture the power cord in one of the side holes so it would serve as a slight lynchpin.
    There is enough tension on the computer's feet and the bottom of the model due to the top pressing down on it that the computer should be secure enough without the power port lynch pin... but it's nice to have that extra security.
  
    All told... the initial prototypes underwent several changes.
    The first prototype used a 2mm wall which turned out to be way too weak at the points where the corners came together.
    The amount of filament on those corners was just not enough to be able to take hardly any abuse.
    Several iterations were needed to get the height, width, depth just right so the computers would slide in/out with the correct amount of tension.
    The monitor "stilts" also took a fair amount of fiddling to get right as well given the tight space and unique design.

    The resulting model turned out nicely, though at least one of the corners ended up cracking/breaking during mounting.

    One of the computers sits off to the side (I call it "[Boss](/docs/subprojects/boss)") under the larger [LCD Touch Screens](../lcd-touch-screen).
    Since this machine drives the two monitors above it, and because they are both a fair bit larger than the dimensions of the computer, it was an easy decision to just take the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen/) model and chop off the "stilts".
    
    With such a simple alteration to an existing design that works well, this only required one prototype to confirm fitments.
    I could have just as well printed the production model from the first attempt, but my luck usually doesn't work that way.

LCD - HDMI Screen:

    I wanted to be sure that each computer's screen could be visible in the lab so one could see everything going on across the whole lab at once.
    The solution to this was to get a handful of small LCD screens that are each paired to a computer in the lab.
    Since space is at a premium in the lab's design, these small screens would need to be mounted above the computers themselves.
    The [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen/) model lets the screens sit on top, mounted from the underside which leaves this model especially simple.
    This model only required the creation of a box that sits on top of the screen as a bezel.
    While the lab would've functioned just fine with the screens' boards being exposed to the open air, it just wouldn't have had much of a finished look.

    Maybe I should've just left well enough alone!
    This model took many attempts to get right due to the fact that the manufacturer doesn't publish specs for the mounting holes and sizes.
    This meant that each attempt had to be built or tweaked from manually measured data - which always leads to suboptimal part fit.
    The first prototype or two was too tight to even fit the screen into the bezel so checking the fit of other through holes in the design couldn't be done.
    Additionally, the size of the screw hole standoffs required a few iterations to get right because of where the screen physically strap.
    To top it off, at least one of the prototypes (maybe more) needed to be tweaked because I moved the screen opening up when I should have moved it down.

    It may have put up a fight, but I especially appreciate the finished look of bezels for all of the lab screens!

LCD - Touch Mount:

    After having built the [LCD touch screen](../lcd-touch-screen) bezel, and after having learned lots of lessons from the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen) model, this one couldn't have been easier.
    It simply needed to align the holes with the underside of the touch screen mounting points.
    One thing detected early on with the design is that an access hole would be needed from the underside in order to screw the screen and mount into the [LCD touch screen](../lcd-touch-screen) bezel.
    It was a good catch during design phase because missing that detail would have required a fix in another prototype.

    With such a simple design, this one almost got away with just a single prototype before production.
    Everything fit fine on the first go - but I didn't like the positioning of the mounting holes to the board, so I adjusted them a bit for the next prototype and also added a few angles to the overall design.
    
    Unfortunately, because there is so little material connecting the mount to the monitor, I suffered a breakage of one of the parts during assembly.
    I might need to revisit this design!

    As final assembly kicked off, I realized something horrible.
    Although the [LCD - Touch Mount](../lcd-touch-mount) needed to have a bit of dremel work post-print done to it in order to fit the 180 degree HDMI adapter, it turns out the USB3 to HDMI adapter I bought isn't Linux compatible *at all*.
    I had the choice of running HDMI off of USB-A via CPU-driven DisplayLink or just using the VGA port built into these cheap-o boxes.
    I opted to go for the VGA port usage, but due to how the boss machine mounts up, this meant VGA adapter would completely intercect with the legs of the existing mount.
    
    Totally winging it, I did some eyeballing measurement to see how much of the mount I would need to take off of the model.
    It looked like I would just clear the vertical upright if it did a straight drop from the connection point with the [LCD touch screen](../lcd-touch-screen) bezel.
    Unfortunately, this also removes quite a bit of material from the mount making an already weak mount even weaker.

    No prototypes were needed because I simply adjusted the existing [LCD - Touch Mount](../lcd-touch-mount), but I may need to revisit the design for added strength.

LCD - Touch Screen:

  content: |-
    While the [LCD - HDMI Screen](../lcd-hdmi-screen) kinda kicked my butt with its design, these larger touch screens were a piece of comparative cake.
    Since the smaller design was set and proven, this design only required adjustments for the scale and the openings.

    This *should have been* a one-prototype build, but the manufacturer did not publish specs for the screen so all measurements were manual.
    Given the manual measurements, the classic first swag/dial in/fine tune prototype design approach played out.
    Interestingly, the thing that gave me the most trouble for these bezels was the tendency for the print to warp and curl away from the print bed.
    This was especially apparent because I twisted the model 45 degrees on the print bed so the lines would be running parallel to the long side of the print.
    As those that have printed a while know: long lines = more curling tendency, especially on the corners.

Platform corner leg:

    Since I wanted the bulk of the lab to be mounted from below, this meant that the board itself couldn't sit flat.
    Sure, the screws could be countersunk into the wood so the board sat flat on the bottom, but I only have a 1/2" board to work with.
    Besides... there's nothing wrong with adding a bit of a "finished flair" to the overall build.
    This design was quite simple to make.
    It aims to capture the edge banding of the wood and also provide cover the joint of the edge band where it meets the next side and also where it meets the board itself.

    With such a simple design, only one prototype was needed to dial in the exact height needed.
    Unfortunately, after I did a production run of four of these, the edge banding came in and turned out to be just slightly thicker than the actual board.
    This meant I had to adjust the height again (another two prototypes) and re-run.

    These were super simple. Once the [platform corner legs](../platform-corner-leg) was dialed in, this model just got rid of the "L" shape.
    The only significant change to the design was to adjust the screw hole and the underside of the mounting.

    Like the [platform corner legs](../platform-corner-leg), these had to be re-run after fixing the height once the edge band was in.
    Otherwise, they were nice and easy.

    Wires - they're ugly! And there are a lot of wires coming out of an ATX power supply.
    I wanted the lab to stay tidy and I also wanted to ensure that any failed component in the lab could easily be replaced.
    With these two things in mind, I decided not to cut the wires coming from the power supply to size.
    Instead, I gathered some ATX extension wires and clipped them into the stock power supply harness.
    With all those wires hanging out, no amount of twisting/curling them would look tidy. They had to be covered!

    This model is especially simple - it just provides a flat point to mount to the board and some lugs for the actual wire cover to mount to it.
    To ensure the power supply and the [Relayinator](../../subprojects/relayinator) were the correct distance, extensions were added to this mount to index those parts onto.
    While it's not much of a problem, if I were to do this mount over again, I would place the mounting holes closer to the lugs holding the top of the cover down.
    Where they sit now allows a fair bit of flex (which can be a good thing) for the mount itself.

    With all those wires hanging out, no amount of twisting/curling them would look tidy. They had to be covered!

    While I decided to create a cover for the ATX power wires, I still didn't want the lab to look especially boring.
    This cover was designed to kind of mimic a "funnel" of all the power flowing from the ATX PSU to the [Relayinator](../../subprojects/relayinator).
    I also wanted to have some visibility into how well the power rails of the cheap ATX power supply were keeping up with demand for the lab.
    With that in mind, I added a landing and holes to hold some 3v - 40v voltmeters - one each for the 5v rail and the 12v rail.

    The design itself was simple enough.
    Because this wasn't a part that needed to hold a rigid object or fit super precicely, only one prototype was needed so long as the lugs on this part fit well into the openings on the [bottom](../power-wire-cover-bottom).
    The harder part of the designw as wrestling with Sketchup to intersect the "landing" and the "funnel" in a sane way that didn't mangle the design.
    Once that was sorted, it was an easy print.

R3S Holster:

  filament: 9.29

  prototypes: 3
  content: |-
    This was yet another design that grew from the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen/) design.
    Conceptually the same, the shape of this design fell into place very easily, but a problem quickly came up.
    The previous holster design allows for the computer to slide in and remain secured by the power cord as a pseudo lynchpin.
    That couldn't work for this device, unfortunately.
    The R3S has a serial header which, for whatever reason, isn't exported on the side of the case.
    This meant that I had to solder the headers onto the board and run the wires through a small hole in the case.
    With such a tiny case, the only place to exit was out the back - which is where all the other ports are.
    Since this wire is coming out of the case, it couldn't slide into the case sideways like the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen/) design.
    Not to fret - after some noodling, I decided to mount this from the top down.
    The mount sits on top of the router and thus has external flanges to secure it to the board.

    Although the design was "novel" compared to what ground was already covered with the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen/) design, only three prototypes were needed to dial it in just right.
    The biggest issue in the prototypes stemmed from a small error in my math whereby the height of the mount was 2mm shorter than it needed to be (oops!)

Switch Holster:
  time:  10:20:29
  filament: 29.44

  prototypes: 3
  content: |-
    This is yet another version of the [holster with screen](../holster-with-screen) design.
    Having taken measurements of the switch and after producing the [ESP LCD screen](../esplcd-screen), this build was as simple as adjusting for the new dimensions.
    
    ... or so I thought. The first prototype failed to launch.
    I didn't notice that the power port protruded from the back of the switch by 1mm.
    Since all of these designs are created to be a snug fit to secure the gear as best as possible, this 1mm bump was enough to break the mount as I forced it in for the test fit.
    After creating a carveout for the power jack on the side that runs the full length of the mount, the next two prototypes were just the usual dial-in builds to get the opening for the power plug and the LEDs positioned just right.

Relayinator Bottom:

  filament: 22.80
  quantity: 1
  prototypes: 3
  content: |-
    This was the very first print of the whole lab because I figured the power management center of the lab will be the most difficult to get right.
    Thinking through the design, I wanted to be sure that the panel holding the barrel connectors had a bit of reinforcement to it so insertion and removal of the connectors doesn't strain/break the panel.
    This is critical because FDM prints are weakest along the layer lines which means bending the upright panel forward or back is straining the weakest point.
    To address this, the panel sits upright and slots into the [top cover](../relayinator-top).

    Sure enough, it took a few attempts to get there.
    The first prototypes were simple fitment prototypes to ensure that the parts would slot together and the mounting screws for the relay board lined up with the holes in the model for it.
    Those came together pretty easily.
    As noted in the [Relayinator](../../subprojects/relayinator) doc, this print had to be reworked once I realized that simply controlling the power to the computers wasn't going to be enough.

Relayinator Top:
  time: 06:43:23
  filament: 25.22
  quantity: 1
  prototypes: 3
  content: |-
    This part mates with the [bottom](../relayinator-bottom) to cover the 8 relay ESP32 board.
    One of the things I wanted to do for this part was to make it so the top could be removed while the board and associated electronics stay mounted.
    For that to work, the parts that interface with the electronics and the wires had to be on the bottom model.
    At the least, this meant the panel to which the plugs attach couldn't be part of the top model.
    The trick was to have the front and back panels slot in to receiving notches the height of the cover model and to make the cover model only cover up the top and two sides.
    Knowing I wanted to mount a small OLED screen to display statuses, a cutout was placed so as to not allow those wires or electronics to interfere with the relay board itself.
    The relays are relatively tall so I knew the OLED could not be mounted above them without raising the overall height of the model (which wastes time and filament!)

    This part came together pretty easily with only three prototypes.
    The adjustments between the prototypes were mostly to fine tune the dimensions, which makes sense since both the top and bottom are designed to mate together (as in: I had all of the required dimensions up front).
    On the first iteration, I didnt' quite think through how to mount the OLED to the cover which was an obvious gap during test fitting.
    A hole with nothing to notch into or index from made it difficult to position the OLED at all.
    To remedy this, I added mounting studs that would locate the OLED exactly where it needed to be, but this design ultimately failed because of how weak a small vertical piece would be.
    
    When I did the last fitment of the first version of [Relayinator](../../subprojects/relayinator), I just melted some extra filament onto the board and the cover which did fine to make the mounting strong enough.
    Unfortunately, I forgot all about this when I had to rejigger the bottom to include static power ports and relay-controlled power ports, which required a reprint of both the top and bottom.
    In retrospect, adding standoffs for some small M2 screws to bite into from the underside like the [LCD HDMI screens](../lcd-hdmi-screen) would have worked quite nicely.
QRCode Holder:

  content: |-
    There's a really cool and handy [QR code to STL model generator](https://printer.tools/qrcode2stl/) out there from [printer.tools](https://printer.tools/) that lets you generate a QR codes as STL files.
    The labinator has one such QR code printed up, but since I do not have a dual extusion head printer, I whipped up a quick holder for the QR code so the outer border could be a solid color rather than 50/50 black and white.
    That's really all there is to this one - nice and simple.

    To construct this model, I just took the generated QR code STL file and imported it into Sketchup.
    Simply grabbing the outline of the shape and using the offset tool to add .3mm gave the inside proportions.
    Using the offset tool again to add the border and extruding to the desired height was all that was left to do.

    With such a simple model, the original print was the final print - no need for many prototypes.
    I did end up printing a second holder and QR code, though.
    To protect the raised edges of the code and give a really nice finished surface, I covered the surface with UV curing resin.
    After curing the resin under the UV lamp, the result was suboptimal.
    The curing resin shrank a bit causing the resulting model to curve a bit - and the surface of the resin had slightly visible "flow" lines in it.
    I'm sure with more tweaking and applying the resin in smaller layers, the result could be as-desired... but a raw 3D print was fine enough for labinator!

    Labinator is cool and all, but what good is that if you can't show it off?
    These are very simple legs that attach to the edge of the mounting board, tilt it back 10 degress, and hold the lab upright on its "side".

    The design was not especially difficult to whip up since I already had perfect dimensions from the [platform corner legs](../platform-corner-leg).
    The main consideration was figuring out what a good angle would be that keeps Labinator upright enough to be seen, but doesn't risk making it fall forward.
    I decided that it'd be stable enough if the length of the support extends twice the distance that the top of the board would sit at.
    Using the trigonometry I hadn't used since college, it was easy enough to figure up.

    Given the size of these supports, amount of infill needed to be robust enough to support the weight of the lab, and overall time to print it, I didn't run any prototypes.
    The design was spot on, so that was great... but the print of the second leg failed about 30 minutes before finishing.
    Oh well! I'm not going to wait another day just for the unseen edge of the bracket to look good!

Carry Handle:

    First, take a look at that print time!
    Much shorter than the others thanks to finally upgrading my 3D printing rig to a [Creality K2 Plus](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-k2-plus-3d-printer)!
    This thing is a beast and prints at a speed that is way faster than my old Ender 3 Pro (this model would have taken about 13.5 hours!), but that's an aside...

    Labinator is a [bit bigger](/docs/improve/#labinator-is-too-big) than I originally figured it would be and can be a hair unwieldy to carry around.
    To address this, I originally bought a hugemongous spinner luggage set, but the it just didn't fit into the suitcase by about 1/2".
    So - I had to think of how to lug this thing around a la plan be.

    I settled on a carry handle design that could snap on/off of the main board.
    I started the design first by figuring out how to create [the lug](../mounting-lug) to be strong enough and built this handle around that.
    The design itself is fairly simple - a rounded rectangle with a large hole in the middle for fingers to grab onto.
    Like most other things in labinator, I gave the edges a bevel because it just looks nicer... but this leads to a more practical design since it's easier to grab and doesn't dig into your fingers while holding.
    I knew roughly what size I needed the opening to be but the overall size of the handle ended up being driven more by ensuring there was enough material for the final design to be strong enough.
    At the same time, I also knew that I had to design to orient the print such that the layer lines ran along the length of the handle.
    This is *vital* because 3D prints are weakest along the layer lines and the tensile strength of the handle is critical to its function.

    I kind of cheated when designing the prototypes for this one.
    Rather than printing a full-size handle, I just printed a small section of the handle that included encasement of the lug until things fit the way I wanted and it all snapped together.
    This took about three or four tries, which aligns with the usual number of protoypes needed for a functional thing.
    Once that was buttoned up, I enhanced the design to include the actual handle.
    This would've worked perfectly on the first try... if the filament didn't snap in the bowden tube about half way through the print.
    Since I was away from the machine when it happened, I didn't catch it and shut the machine down as it sat there prompting me to replace the filament.
    Oops.
    So, kicking it off again it, it printed perfectly fine (no filament breakage this time) and the handle fit perfectly on the first try.

    [Carry Handles](../carry-handle) are great, but how do you mount them to the main board?
    With a mounting lug, of course!
    This simple little design is a little bit more than just a simple block with some holes in it.
    Not only does the lug need to be strong enough to hold the weight of the lab, but it also needs to be designed to allow the handle to snap on and off.
    To satisfy the first goal, I couldn't deny the strength of good old fashioned metal.
    The lug has two holes for M6 bolts (which I just so happened to have handy since that's the size of rack mount screws I use) to pass through the lug and bite into receiving aluminum nuts that pass through the board.
    Hitting the second goal meant that I needed the lug to allow a slide on/off design leading to the taper you see in the model.

    The taper turned out to be pretty important because it allows the handle to slide and clip on without needing double the length of the mounting lug open inside the handle.
    The lug is also angled inward from front to back which serves to "pull" the handle tight against the board when mounted leading to a stronger overall connection.
    This angle also prevents the handle from just slipping off vertically.

    The design itself was pretty simple, but I did have to noodle a bit on how to get the taper and the angle just right.
    Like most other things, it took a few prototypes to get it right... and I realized during prototyping that my original goal of creating two lugs and making a U-shaped handle.
    Just wouldn't work because of the bolt heads on the back of the board interfering.
    So, we're just gonna have to YOLO it with a single lug in the center of the board!
