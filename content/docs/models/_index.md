One of the principles of Labinator is that it had to be portable.
While there are a lot of cheap/easy ways to meet this requirement, it certainly doesn't cause any harm to add a little [flair/polish](../about/#why-should-it-be-portable) to everything.
Besides... home labbing is an awesome hobby - so why not incorporate *more hobbies* into the process?

Enter: 3D modeling and 3D printing

During the pandemic I finally broke down and bought a 3D printer.
I've always been interested in them and like many others, I had a bit more time on my hands than I knew what to do with!
Having experimented with spline-based and polygonal 3D modeling in the past as well as playing around in Sketchup for years for other projects needing a twist of 3D, I dove in.

The below models were designed with the objectives of providing secure mounting for the portable lab, a modest amount of protection for the components while traveling, and the ability to be mounted/unmounted (possibly with some disassembly of Labinator) to replace components.

Since I had lots of experience with Sketchup, and because these are simple geometric models, it was the natural choice to design with.
